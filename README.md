# Determine Water Stations
You can find the website here: https://determine-water-stations-1.onrender.com/

For demo purposes, please download the file titled 'DWR_Charlie Card Challenge.gpx' and use that to show the functionality of the app.

This basic app allows a user to input a GPX file and determine where water stations should be located. The user simply has to upload the GPX file and the desired distance between water stations, and the app outputs the longitude/latitude of water stations based on the GPX route. The website uses Render to host the app.
