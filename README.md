# Determine Water Stations
You can find the website here: https://determine-water-stations-1.onrender.com/

This is a basic webapp that allows a user to input a GPX file and determine where water stations should be located. The user simply has to upload the GPX file and desired distance between water stations, and the app output the longitude/latitude of water stations based on the GPX route. The website uses Render to host the app.
